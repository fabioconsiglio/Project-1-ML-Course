This `readme-file` serves as a short guide to reproduce the results of our analysis involving the Franke function and real terrain data. 

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories: **Franke Function Analysis** and **Real Terrain Data Analysis**. Each directory follows a consistent structure to facilitate understanding and reproducibility.

### 1. Franke Function Analysis

- **Directory:** `franke_function_analysis`
  - **Notebook:** `franke_function_1.ipynb`
    - This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for analyzing the Franke function.
  - **Miscellaneous File:** `miscellaneous.py`
    - This Python file contains all functions utilized in the Jupyter Notebook for calculations and visualizations.
  - **Figures Folder:** 
    - A dedicated folder containing all figures produced during the analysis.

### 2. Real Terrain Data Analysis

- **Directory:** `real_data_analysis`
  - **Notebook:** `real_data_analysis.ipynb`
    - This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for analyzing the terrain data.
  - **Miscellaneous File:** `miscellaneous.py`
    - This Python file contains all functions necessary for the terrain data analysis.
  - **TIF File:**
    - The terrain data in TIF format is located in the same directory for easy access.
  - **Figures Folder:**
    - A dedicated folder containing all figures generated from the terrain data analysis.

## Additional Resources

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Files:**
  - This repository also includes existing but unfinished OOP files, such as data handlers and modules for various regression models.
